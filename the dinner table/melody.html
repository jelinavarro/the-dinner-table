            As minutes pass, only the melodyâ€™s faint sounds stay behind. 
            Barely quiet enough, the soft crackles of what seems to be 
            a vinyl record resonate in the room. The record box was on 
            top of a shelf with a collection of 
          <a class = "clickable" href = "games.html">
            <b><i>board games</i></b>
          </a>
            and discs. 
            Beside the box sat a 
          <a class = "clickable" href = "vase.html">
            <b><i>ceramic vase</i></b>
          </a>
            with hydrangeas. Suddenly, the melody turns distorted. Parts 
            of the song become fuzzy and the instruments muffled. The 
            vinyl record endures spinning until its last breath. Silence.
